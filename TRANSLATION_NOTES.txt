Requirements: gettext, and a po file editor.

If you make code changes, please run the following before committing and submitting a pull request:
./t_01_update_pot.sh
./t_01_update_pot.sh
./t_03_build.sh

These will refresh the .pot file from the current code, update all .po files from the updated .pot,
and build new .mo files from the .po files.

To start a translation of a new language (German in this example):
Using the po editing tool of your choice (I like poedit), create a new .po from the .pot file. Name the file with 
the appropriate two-digit language code. For German, you'd create po/de.po from po/trelby.po.

Then populate the translations for all the strings in the new .po.

To test, run:
./t_03_build.sh
LANG=de ./trelby.py

And see if things look as expected.

When you're finished, run ./t_03_build.sh, git add the new .po file, commit, push, and submit a pull request.

Thank you!
